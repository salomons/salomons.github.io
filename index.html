                Google open sourced their machine intelligence library <a
                    href="http://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>
                the 1st of November 2015. The primary use case for the library is deep learning, but it can also be used
                more generally as a distributed mathematical library, e.g. solving partial differential equations.
                I recently worked on a research project where I implemented a sequence model for a traditional NLP task
                with very good results. This post is not about the details of the model, but rather an evaluation of
                working with a high level tool like TensorFlow for doing deep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tensorflow's core is implemented in C++ and CUDA C, but you write your application in Python. Programming
                wise it is a bit different to normal programming since you design your computational graph of nodes that
                will be run later, e.g a mix of imperative and symbolic programming. Below is an
                image of a one hidden layer feed forward neural network on the MNIST
                digit recognition data. I will not go into details how to use tensorflow but rather share my experience
                using it. For those interested in learning tensorflow have a look at the excellent official
                <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/0.6.0/tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a>.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: green;">The Advantages</h4>
            <p>
                To me there are three major advantages.
            </p>

            <h5>Productivity</h5>
            <p>
            I had three weeks from start to finished article. I had no prior experience with TensorFlow. It took me
            two weeks to implement a new state-of-the-art model, which is not very much time. Especially considering
            that first week was basically just to learn the library. I would estimate that it would take me 2-3x times
            longer to implement the final model in C++. However, the biggest gain in productivity was the flexibility.
            E.g. to make the training of the the initial state to the LSTM cell configurable I only needed to
            add
            <pre><code>init_state = tf.Variable([...]) if train_init_state else tf.zeros([...])</code></pre>
            </p>
            But what about the gradients? You need not to worry about that, since your computational graph uses 
            automatic differentiation (basically the chain rule on the composed function that is your graph). This 
            feature is great, but nothing new, see <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">theano</a>.

            <h5>Distributes in a cluster with(out) GPUs</h5>
            <p>
                The benefit of not coding towards a specific hardware configuration is tremendous. TensorFlow will
                use the resources you have. If it is not fast enough, get another gpu or add another node and run
                again without changing your code.
            </p>

            <h5>Easy to use in production</h5>
            <p>
                Tensorflow is excellent for research with its flexibility, but it's also excellent for production.
                When you are happy with your model you can export the C++ code for the model and use on any device
                with a C++ compiler and call it from any language that can call C/C++ functions.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color:red;">The Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>... and two disadvantages, of which one is hopefully temporarily.</p>

            <h5>Immature Release</h5>
            <p>
                The open source release is quite immature. A lot of operations don't have a cuda implementation,
                it's currently not distributed (official reason is that it is entangled with internal apis, but will
                be released soon) and the performance are/were not as good as its competitors.
            </p>

            <h5>Once the graph is created there is not much flexibility left</h5>
            <p>
                When the graph is constructed you are supposed to execute it, not change it. This means that there is
                no way of deferring decisions with conditionals and loops, e.g. I had a lot of issues with variable
                length sequences. You can partly mitigate the problem by doing bucketing of sentences of similar lengths.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                I very much believe that the future of tools for computationally expensive program is to analyze high level
                programs and distribute it for you on the available accelerators and nodes. The question is if it will
                be TensorFlow or any other similar tool (<a href="https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet">mxnet</a>).
                At the moment TensorFlow has great traction, the github repo is quite active and Google has put a lot of
                effort into to library and the open source launch.
